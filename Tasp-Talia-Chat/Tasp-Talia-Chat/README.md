* TASP* is a stock price notifier bot that notifies the user when their desired stocks need to be sold and also need to be bought. It uses the yahoo finance api from the yahoo finace website (totally not sponsored *cough cough): https://finance.yahoo.com/ Also it's now built with TALIA.

### What's üåêTalia (Totally Artificial Language Intelligence Assistant)?

* TALIA stands for Totally Artificial Language Intelligence Assistant. Talia* was included to allow AI like chat based functionality for the user in the form of a virtual assistant that **actually talks to you (in a British accent)**.
* You can do a number of commands like ask the: weather, date, time, jokes, stocks, translate, wiki, youtube... In this case, I searched for elonmusk using the wiki command...

## Why ü§î?
* I wanted to create this Tasp program so it could notfiy me when it's a good time to buy stocks and to sell stocks through the use of the set max price and low price for each stock (which you can change in the code). In this case, the default stock is AAPL(Apple) and the max price to sell is 112 and 110 to buy. You can choose to change these to whatever you want*

* Also it's designed to work in the background and can be run and stopped in the traybar (so you can run it while you're doing other things) but you can look at the data in the console if you want :/
* In terms of Talia, Talia can help you to do a number of stock/trading tasks like plot chart, update portfolio, view portfolio, portfolio gains, portfolio value...

# Beta Software Program
