# T.A.S.P

# What's T.A.S.P?
T.A.S.P stands for "Totally Auto Stock Pinger" and was made in Python. I couldn't think of any other names :/

T.A.S.P is a stock price notifier bot that notifies the user when their desired stocks need to be sold and also need to be bought.
It uses the yahoo finance api from the yahoo finace website (totally not sponsored *cough cough): https://finance.yahoo.com/

# Why?

I wanted to create this program so it could notfiy me when it's a good time to buy stocks and to sell stocks through the use of the set max price and low price for each stock (which you can change in the code). In this case, the default stock is AAPL(Apple) and the max price to sell is 112 and 110 to buy. You can choose to change these to whatever you want*

Also it's designed to work in the background (so you can run it while you're doing other things) but you can look at the data in the console if you want :/
